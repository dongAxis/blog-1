# Original motivation

> When you change a data type using CHANGE or MODIFY, MySQL tries to convert existing column values to the new type as well as possible.

The semantics for `ALTER TABLE tabl_name MODIFY col_name column_definition` ([reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/alter-table.html))
is actually undefined. Let's go for understanding what's happening under the hood.

 Â - connection pooling
