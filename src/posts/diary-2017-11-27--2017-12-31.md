- calculus
  - world is continuous
  - differential: rate of change of some entity
      - why is this useful?
      - because, in this world, there are many entities which can be "nicely" represented by other entity in terms of the rate of changes.
      - eg newton's law, electromagnetism, differential equation, ..
      - approximate stuff with arbitrary order of polynomials
  - integraral: summation of entity over some domain
      - why is this useful?
      - summation over changing entity doesn't seem trivial, but that's the case of free falling.
        The rate of distance change (aka elocity) is changing and we wanna know how much distance changes.
      - when entity is only changing linearly, it's possible to obtain in a geometrical way (like triangle).
      - via "fundamental theorem of calculus", integral can be calculated if you know antiderivative.
