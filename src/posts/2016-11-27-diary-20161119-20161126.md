- read Kconfig around net/bluetooth and drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi
- what's firmware ?
  - quotes from LDD3 section "Dealing with Firmware"

> The competition in many parts of the hardware market is so intense that even the cost of a bit of EEPROM for the device’s controlling firmware is more than the manufacturer is willing to spend. So the firmware is distributed on a CD with the hardware, and the operating system is charged with conveying the firmware to the device itself.

- bit about Type1-virtualization, Xen
  - https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/

  - 3 Basic Concepts
      - entity, name, variable?
  - 3.1 Declarations and Definitions
      - definition is a special case of declaration
  - 3.3.1 Declarative regions and scopes
  - 3.3.6 Namespace scope
      - global namespace
  - 7.3.4 Using directive
  - 3.10 Lvalues and rvalue?

      > Historically, lvalues and rvalues were so-called because they could appear on the left- and right-hand side of an assignment (although this is no longer generally true); glvalues are “generalized” lvalues, prvalues are “pure” rvalues, and xvalues are “eXpiring” lvalues. Despite their names, these terms classify expressions, not values.

  - 7.1.7.1 The cv-qualifiers
      - const, volatile is implementation specific
  - static type and dynamic type??
  - 7.1.7.4 The auto specifier
  - 23.3.11 Class template vector
  - 8.6.4 List-initialization
  - 24 Iterators library
  - inherently ambiguous syntax
      - 8.2 Ambiguity resolution (of declarators)

- 5.3.4 New (expression) in C++
  - _array_ is special:

    > If the entity is a non-array object, the new-expression returns a pointer to the object created. If it is an array, the new-expression returns a pointer to the initial element of the array.

- Analyze how multi dimentional vector works
  - container object calls destructor of inner elements before it delete itself? (this depends on `allocator<T>`)
  - container object allocates space on heap? (of course)
  - 23.3.11.2 vector constructors, copy, and assignment
  - 20.10.9 The default allocator
  - 17.6.3.5 Allocator requirements
  - just find the definitions around these (e.g. `allocator<vector<int>>`) in the wild (libcxx/include/experimental/vector)
- copy? CopyInsertable?

- tcp connection(s) within single http request/response 
  - single http request/response must be done within single tcp connection?
    - I think so. if tcp layer is in trouble, http client can show tcp layer error (like SIGPIPE).
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
  - https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/connecting
 
    > Disconnection occurs when: A client stops reading data suddenly. If the rate of Tweets being read off of the stream drops suddenly, the connection will be closed.

    - how could tcp sender know how much data tcp receiver read? (is it possible by using normal TCP socket interface implemented in Linux kernel?)
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793

- read http://clang.llvm.org/docs/InternalsManual.html

- read c++ standard n4606: 20.11Smart pointers
  - ? distinction of `operator=` (from 20.11.1.2.3 unique_ptr assignment) and lvalue ?
  - is this implementable as "plain" c++ syntax? (like, those operators `->`, `=`)
  - unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr
      - there's no `weak_ptr(T* ptr)`

- Use wine for AKAI software
  - jack, wine, [sforzando](http://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando/) worked perfect!
  - read https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_Developer%27s_Guide/Architecture_Overview
  - just curious about windows api: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff818516(v=vs.85).aspx
  - just curious about mono: http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/

# 2016/11/25-26

- Chrom{e,ium}
  - read http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/startup
  - read https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome
      - multi process model, V8 design, some UX/UI thing, sandbox, gears?
- Memory models and Concurrency
  - should've read this first: GCC Wiki: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/AtomicSync

      > The real difference boils down to how much state the hardware has to flush in order to synchronize.

      - it also acts as a constraint for instruction reordering by optimizer.

  - shouldn't have tried to read C++ n4606: 
      - 1.10 Multi-threaded executions and data races
      - 29 Atomic operations library
  - LLVM
      - http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#memmodel
      - it's mostly only for inheriting (keeping) semantics of C++0x (a.k.a. C++11) memory model.
      - semantics for IR itself doesn't concern with multi thread execution.
      - code generation: http://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html
  - know Platform (OS, Hardware) dependent facility for those memory models (or inter threads memory synchronization thing)
      - https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/cpp0xmappings.html
