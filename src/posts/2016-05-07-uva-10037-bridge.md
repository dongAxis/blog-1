[Problem definition](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/100/10037.pdf)

I had no idea how to achieve optimality, so I consulted two references about this problem:

- [algorithmist](http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/UVa_10037)
- [codingstrife](https://codingstrife.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/solution-uva10037-pc110403-bridge/)

Both references mentions that:

When the number of people is more than or equal to 4, the problem can be broken down into 

- move slowest 2 people to the other side,
- repeat this until the number of people is less than 4.

Technically speaking, this "break down problem" is a crucial step to prove the optimality of the algorithm by _induction_, which is not obvious for me to understand intuitively.

So, I tried to formalize and prove a statement, but I failed. Here is some of notes about this.

Rests are my crappy notes:
