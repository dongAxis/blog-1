- Kernel interrupt/exception handling
  - what x86 does (see "Hardware Handling of Interrupts and Exceptions")
      - hardware changes:
          - instruction pointer (`cs` and `eip` loaded from _IDT_)
          - stack pointer (`ss` and `esp` loaded from _TSS_. this doesn't happen if cpu is already in kernel mode ?)
  - is x86 thread_info only unsigned long? (where is precious preempt_count ?)
      - see preempt.h
  - other x86 things
      - arch/x86/include/asm/irq_vectors.h
      - arch/x86/include/asm/segment.h
  - summerize again terminology
      - preempt (kernel)
          - non voluntarily process switch during kernel mode
          - see section "kernel preemption)
          - process preemption in scheduling lingo
              - one process preempts other process
      - reentrant (code)
          - run code (function) in a nested way on the same cpu
          - e.g. interrupt handling
      - concurrent (data)
          - run same code or access same data from multiple cpus
  - type of things
      - exception
          - started from user mode instruction (__except page fault__)
          - exception handling don't (mostly) nest each other as long as we assume kernel is bug free. syscall can induce page fault, so thery can nest.
          - interrupt handling could start when cpu is exception-handling kernel control path.
          - context switch can happen for page fault handler.
      - interrupt
          - interrupt handling could nest each other 
          - exception handling (including page faults) won't start here as long as we assume kernel is bug free
          - context switch won't happen, or I/O device interrupt doesn't refer to data specific to the current process.
          - but, when return from interrupt (e.g. schedular_tick), process can switch.
      - (fast) system call
          - we can categorize it as "exception" since it's user mode process initiated thing.
          - http://wiki.osdev.org/SYSENTER, http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/SYSCALL.html
          - interrupt handling could start when cpu is in system call kernel path 
          - page fault handling could start 
          - context switch can happen (e.g. schedule() for block IO, sleep timer, etc ...)
  - anyway, page fault exception handling is so special.
  - bottom half scheduling
      - softirq (tasklet)
      - workqueue
  - still confusing terms
      - (A)PIC ((advanced) programmable interrupt controller)
      - PCI (peripheral component interconnect)
      - ACPI (advanced configuration and power interface)

- Kernel timer interrupt for process scheduling
  - two types: per-cpu one (apic) and global one
  - per-cpu one is crutial for process scheduling
  - x86/kernel/apic/apic.c
      - kernel_init_freeable -> smp_prepare_cpus (x86/include/asm/smp.h) -> smp_ops.smp_prepare_cpus (smp.c) -> smp_prepare_cpus () -> native_smp_prepare_cpus -> apic_bsp_setup -> x86_init.timers.setup_percpu_clockev -> setup_APIC_timer -> clockevents_register_device -> ... -> `dev->event_handler = tick_handle_periodic`

- Kernel module
  - build system
      - macros: `CONFIG_MODULES` `MODULE`
  - user land interface
      - module dependency is resolved on user land by `modprobe`
      - single module loading by `init_module`, `finit_module`
      - see busybox/modutils
  - dependency
      - modules.dep, System.map
      - how do you describe it in kernel module source? (some KBuild thing or some macro?)
          - you don't have to describe. `depmod` does it automatically by checking exported symbols.
  - ? initialization (code, data, data/function symbol resolution)
      - how do you know kernel's existing symbol's address (kernel text and data) ?
      - see apply_relocate_add (in arch/x86/kernel/module.c)
  - understand elf format
      - especially, external symbol representation (variable reference, function call)
      - read include/uapi/linux/elf.h

- ? Kernel I/O scheduling

- ? Nginx reading
  - follow the basic code path:
      - socket -> listen -> poll -> accept -> read(recv) -> write(send)

- ? Clang/LLVM casual walkthrough
  - clang optimization
  - llvm optimization

- ? device hotplug with udev/uevent
  - basically `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT`
  - read systemd/udevd.c
  - netlink(7)
  - https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/generic_netlink_howto

- Kernel logging facility
  - /proc/kmsg, /dev/kmsg, syslog(2)
      - /dev/kmsg is one of `devlist[]` in linux/drivers/char/mem.c
  - tools: dmesg, systemd-journald, rsyslog (/var/log/kern.log)
  - read linux/kernel/printk/printk.c, fs/proc/kmsg.c
  - read busybox/util-linux/dmesg.c

- Kernel tty
  - User space:
  - systemd (pid1) (see http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/serial-console.html)
      - getty.target (see systemd.special(7))
      - getty@.service (with Restart=always)
      - ? how systemd spawns getty dynamically (I couldn't find corresponding code)
  - busybox/loginutils/getty.c
      - setsid (see setsid(2))
      - open tty (specified as an argument) as stdin/stdout/stderr
      - ioctl(TIOCSCTTY) (see tty_ioctl(4))
      - setup tty attributes
      - execve to login process
  - busybox/loginutils/login.c
      - no tty work here
      - call pam library and vfork-exec shell process if authenticated
      - what happens after shell exits depends on pid1. (for this case, since getty@.service has Restart=always, it goes back to getty.)
  - ? how tmux handles pseudo ttys
  - ? ssh client/server
  - GUI terminal emulator (e.g. xterm)
      - pts(4) and simulate tty with GUI input/output.
  - Kernel things:
  - Kconfig:
      - TTY (tty subsystem)
      - VT (virtual terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F1 things))
      - VT_CONSOLE (system console for single user mode)
  - how many kinds of device files out there ? (device number and initialization step)
      - tty_init      
          - 5:0 - /dev/tty
          - 5:1 - /dev/console
      - vty_init
          - 4:0 - /dev/tty0
      - tty_register_driver(console_driver)
          - 4:1...63 - /dev/tty1...63
      - vty_init -> vcs_init
          - 7:0 - /dev/vcs
          - 7:1 - /dev/vcs1
          - 7:128 - /dev/vcsa
          - 7:129 - /dev/vcsa1
      - con_init
          - ? I think this is not something used for use space, so let's skip it?
      - /dev/ttyS0...31
  - kernel parameters: console
  - keymap (dumpkeys, loadkeys) is a kernel thing
  - initialization steps
      - start_kernel -> console_init -> (console_initcall) -> con_init
      - start_kernel -> rest_init -> kernel_thread(kernel_init, ...) -> kernel_init -> kernel_init_freeable -> do_basic_setup -> do_initcalls -> (fs_initcall) -> chr_dev_init -> tty_init -> vty_init
  - let's forget about `VT_CONSOLE` for now. Understand how virtual console works.
  - eary things
      - register_console (printk.c)
  - serial, tty, console, display server (Xorg)
  - does Xorg needs to know about virtual console ? (I mean, does it know about `fg_console` or `change_console` things ?)
  - vt switching (there're many entrypoint which you can find by grepping `set_console`)
      - ioctl (e.g. VT_ACTIVATE) -> set_console -> console_callback (vt.c) -> change_console (vt_ioctl.c) -> ... -> redraw_screen, wake_up_interruptible(&vt_event_waitqueue);
      - ? does "ctrl-alt-F1" corresponds to `k_cons` which is `*(k_handler[5])(...)`
  - drivers/vt/keyboard.c
      - initialization: kbd_init -> input_register_handler(&kbd_handler) -> kbd_connect -> ...
      - event handling: kbd_event -> kbd_keycode -> tty_insert_flip_char,  atomic_notifier_call_chain(&keyboard_notifier_list, ...)
      - process read operation:
          - tty_read => tty->ldisc->ops->read (which is n_tty_read) => copy_from_read_buf
          - ? how `tty->disc_data (n_tty_data)` and `tty->port->buf` relate each other
      - ? how do you deal with hot-plugged keyboard (since it looks like `kbd_init` is only called at kernel initialization step) ?
  - drivers/vt/vc_screen.c
      - process write operation:
          - tty_write => 
      - ? how to hook with display driver ? (including monitor choice things)
          - who displays "vc_data" physically ?
  - ? how tty_operations and file_operations relate each other ?
      - struct cdev => file_operations
      - struct tty_struct, tty_driver => tty_operations 
      - tty_driver => tty_struct
      - tty_driver => cdev, device
      - tty_register_driver => ... => driver->cdevs[index]->ops = &tty_fops

- GNU Make
  - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html

- ssh and tmux
  - setup: install tmux on remote host
  - workflow:
      - run `ssh <remote host>`
      - run `tmux` (it starts tmux process and attaches current console from sshd's shell to tmux's initial shell)
      - ... do things on shells under tmux ...
      - detach console from tmux's shell by `C-b d` (you can detach even when running a process under tmux's shell)
      - exit from ssh
      - run `ssh <remote host>` and attach to existing shell by `tmux attach`
  - internal 
      - `tmux` process runs under `init` instead of `sshd`
      - shell processes are children of `tmux` process
      - ? know more about console and child process handling
