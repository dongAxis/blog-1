- Calculate all crossing points from half plains
- From those crossing points, select a point if it is included in all half plains
  - After this selection, points already form convex
- calculate convex area by the same approach I used here: http://wp.hiogawa.net/2016/04/10/uva-10065-useless-tile-picker/
  - it is interesting enough to note that the sign of signed area is directly used as a comparison function for couter-clockwise point sorting. [here is that part of the code](https://github.com/hi-ogawa/haskell_playground/blob/a61dd4199ffb963dca2dcd293181088488882cbe/src/Uva/P10084.hs#L74-L80)

 - calculate crossing points from given line segments in $O((n + k)\log(n))$ where `n` is a number of line segments and `k` is a number of crossing points. naively it's $O(n^2)$.
