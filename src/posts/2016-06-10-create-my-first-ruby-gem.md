I followed [http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/ ) and made my first ruby gem [hi-ogawa/playground](https://github.com/hi-ogawa/ruby_playground).
It's always a good practice not to start from wrapper such as [Jeweler](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler), which, of course, I will try next.
I setup my gem development with [rubocop](http://rspec.info/) and [rspec](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop), and those commands are run in [travis](https://travis-ci.org/hi-ogawa/ruby_playground).
