intuitive understanding of polygon area calculation by using determinant:

__Goal__

- Understand _Green's theorem_
  - [o] start from definition of _line integral_
     - those two facts matters
         - uniqueness of line integral
         - orientation fixed
  - [o] explicitly expand the theorem equation to remove confusion
  - [o] intuitively understand with area calculation case
  - [x] look for the general case proof
- [o] Green't theorem's application for _area calculation_ with simple case
- [o] _Planimeter_ explained via Green's theorem
- [o] Verteces based polygon area calculation equation explained following above
