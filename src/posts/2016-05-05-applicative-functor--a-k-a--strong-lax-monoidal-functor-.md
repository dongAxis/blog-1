### Summery

- Motivation

- Use case:

- Theoretical exposition:


The most important line:

> pure function applied to funny arguments 


- Compositionality of _Applicative Functor_ comes from Compositionality of _strong lax monoidal functor_.

- I don't know how to deal with usual _functor_ for additional type constructor in language.

### Notes

- Original motivation for giving semantics to effectful computation by _Monad_ is:
  - equational reasoning
- But, by removing monadic equation constraint, what _Applicative_ does is to give semantics to effectful computation which could bring:
  - faster effect resolution (e.g. reader, parallel computation, _Traversable_),
  - "practically interesting" effect resolution (e.g. matrix transposition).
- I don't feel "more than one free variable" is not the point of strength required for applicative...

- In Haskell (or in $Sets$), any _Functor_ is _strong_. So, I think _strong_-ness shouldn't be emphasized in this discussion, it's confusing.

- What kind of "formal language" are we talking about for _Applicative_ computation?
  - it will be "language without _let_ (a.k.a binding)"
  - what's the crucial difference of "join" and "crushing effect (traverse effect along data structure)"?
    - traverse doesn't require "binding" ?
