- Kernel process management
  - can one process be passed around several processes? (Yes)
      - look how scheduler picks next process
          - `schedule()` itself sticks with only its own `runqueue` (per cpu variable).
      - then, I hope `do_fork` will scatter new process into other cpu runqueue?
          - hell yeah! `__set_task_cpu(p, select_task_rq(p, task_cpu(p), SD_BALANCE_FORK, 0))` in `wake_up_new_task`
      - ? load_balance
  - life time of kernel stack
      - creation: `ret_from_fork`
      - switching: `switch_to`
      - deletion: `release_task` (which is called from `exit` or parent's `wait`)
          - how parent's gonna take on child's kernel stack ??
          - `do_task_dead` calls `__schedule(false)`
      - ? preemption: `ret_from_exception`, `ret_from_interrupt`

- Kernel (virtual) file system
  - VFS, FS (on memory), FS (on disk)
      - filesystem module is device (device driver) independent
      - device (device driver) is filesystem independent   
      - so those two are communicated via block device subsystem interface ?
      - VFS might access device _directly as device file_ or _via FS as "regular" file_
  - important types
      - fs/mount.h (struct mount)
      - include/linux/mount.h (struct vfsmount)
      - include/linux/fs.h (struct super_block (void *s_fs_info))
      - fs/ext4/ext4.h (struct ext4_sb_info, ...)
  - initial file system setup
      - provisional one ("rootfs"): start_kernel -> vfs_caches_init -> mnt_init -> init_rootfs, init_mount_tree -> vfs_kern_mount(.., "rootfs", ..)
      - real one: kernel_init (pid 1) -> ... -> prepare_namespace -> ... -> do_mount_root -> ... -> sys_chroot
          - how come kernel can mount device? I think `wait_for_device_probe` will do.
          - how come kernel recognizes `root=UUID=...` as an argument of `sys_mount`

- Kernel system call interface
  - ? about POSIX "api"
  - `sys_<name>`, `do_<name>` and `SYSCALL_DEFINE<n>`
  - how libc (glibc or musl) calls system call ? architecture specific?
  - MSR (model specific register) interface for system call?

  - image building

        vmlinux (under compressed) -> vmlinux.bin (under boot)
          - vmlinux.lds.S -> vmlinux.lds (scripts/Makefile.build)
          - piggy.S -> piggy.o (scripts/Makefile.build)
      - arch/x86/boot/main.c ... -(setup.ld)-> setup.elf -(objcopy)-> setup.bin
      - arch/x86/boot/tools/build.c vmlinux.bin setup.bin zoffset.h -> bzImage
  - where is `setup_64` (or `setup_32`) ?
  - where is `start_kernel` gonna be saved ?

- Xen hyperviser
  - just build and learn: https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Compiling_Xen_From_Source
  - ? what's the kernel of the hyperviser ?
      - Xen is
  - how special is dom0 kernel ?
  - dom0 kernel drives devices.
      - wtf? then how hyperviser boot without anything?
  - how it's related to kvm (cpu, memory emulator), qemu (peripherals emulator)

  - /dev/disk/...
  - ? how to read spec of storage products
  - ? intel ahci on sata
  - ? linux full backup, bootable external hdd?
- steps
  - `sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=64K`
  - fdisk /dev/sdb (write (update partition table))
  - fdisk /dev/sdb ((?) increase partition for root filesystem)
  - make sure /dev/sdb boot up
  - replace SSD
  - boot /dev/sdb
  - dd /dev/sdb /dev/sda
  - boot with /dev/sda
  - setup refind again (refind-install from ubuntu live image)
  - read only file system
  - fsck /dev/sda -y
  - `df` disk usage still give me the previous data. run `resize2fs`

```
$ sudo resize2fs /dev/sda3
resize2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Filesystem at /dev/sda3 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 8, new_desc_blocks = 16
The filesystem on /dev/sda3 is now 67108864 (4k) blocks long.
```
