- Chromium
  - what "browser" does in general: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
  - http://aosabook.org/en/posa/high-performance-networking-in-chrome.html
      - network resource optimizations
      
      > Chromeâ€™s network stack is much, much more than a simple socket handler.

  - http rfc
      - Persistent connection: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.1

      - looks like GN replaced GYP recently.
  - `WebCore::` to `blink::` transition is completely done?

- HTTPS
  - try letsencrypt with certbot
      - it works fine, but I didn't like to setup automation for three months certificate renewal.
  - try ACM (amazon certificate management)
      - free certificate, but limited use only for aws-managed load balancer and cloudfront
  - use cloudflare only as DNS

- (My)SQL Language

- Kernel build system
  - `vmlinux` target is custom kbuild command (makefiles.txt 6.8)
  - htop during make shows how "Kbuild" is working.

      ```
        make -O=<build dir> all -j 4
        make -C <build dir> KBUILD_SRC=<kernel dir> -f <kernel dir>/Makefile all
        make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=<some Kbuild target>
        ...
      ```   
  - 2nd one is from target `sub-make` in top level Makefile
  - main target chain

      ```
      ## in top level Makefile ##
      vmlinux-dirs	:= $(patsubst %/,%,$(filter %/, $(init-y) $(init-m) \
              	     $(core-y) $(core-m) $(drivers-y) $(drivers-m) \
              	     $(net-y) $(net-m) $(libs-y) $(libs-m) $(virt-y)))
       
      vmlinux: scripts/link-vmlinux.sh vmlinux_prereq $(vmlinux-deps) FORCE
       
      $(sort $(vmlinux-deps)): $(vmlinux-dirs) ;
       
      $(vmlinux-dirs): prepare scripts
              $(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=$@

      ## in scripts/Kbuild.include ##
      build := -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.build obj
      ```
  - scripts/Makefile.lib handles subdirectory structure preparation `subdir-ym`

- JIT implementation
  - what is a portable way of JIT (runtime code generation and execution). 
      - what I can think of is using `mmap` with `PROT_EXEC` and `MAP_ANONYMOUS` though.
      - yeah, I'm goddamn right! (see llvm/lib/Support/Unix/Memory.inc `Memory::allocateMappedMemory`)
      - is it not possible to create some tmp file and `dlopen` it?
  - follow `void MCJIT::generateCodeForModule(Module *M)`
  - read http://llvm.org/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.html
  - ? freaking dynamic linker implementation `RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObjectImpl`
  - ? learn ELF relocatable format and dlopen implementation (musl/ldso/dynlink.c)

- Kernel memory management
  - how to communicate with MMU
      - x86: cr0 (PG flag) and cr3
  - Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.txt, Documentation/vm, arch/x86/include/asm/page_64_types.h
  - kernel virtual memory only accesable first 47 bit space + last 47 bit space = 48 bits = 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 12 bits
  - proc/pid/pagemap: https://lwn.net/Articles/230975/
      - memstat(1), smemstat(1)
      - PSS: proportional set size
      - USS: unique set size
  - proc/meminfo, free(1)
  - LDD: chapter 15 (Memory Mapping and DMA)
  - Understanding Linux Kernel: chapter 2 (Memory Addressing), 8 (Memory Management)
      - this book use a term "linear address", which is not used in LDD.
  - Several memory management hierarchy
      - buddy system (page frame management)
          - `struct page * alloc_pages(gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order)`
          - `unsigned long __get_free_pages(gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order)`
          - does this always return memory from "direct mapping of all phys. memory"? (I think so)
      - slab allocator (smaller-than-single-page-frame memory management without messing with kernel page tables)
          - `void *kmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags)`
      - virtually-contiguous-but-not-physically-contiguous multi pages memory management by messing with kernel page tables
          -  `void *vmalloc(unsigned long size)`
  - what kind of kernel things won't be swapped out? or is it even possible to swap kernel virtual address ? (depends)
  - could `vmalloc` swap out some kernel virtual address? (I think so, see `do_page_fault`)
  - ? why kernel text is not included in 64TB direct mapping starting from PAGE_OFFSET?
  - x86 mmu considers access rights depending on ring level?
      - there's a User/Superviser flag in page table

- Kernel memory management for process
  - user process driven thing: `do_mmap`, `do_brk` (stack growth is handled `expand_stack` in `do_page_fault`)
      - we don't need to allocate page frame but isn't it necessary to update page tables? can we wait until page fault? (looks like so, see `handle_mm_fault` below)
      - Of course, `do_munmap` does `free_pgtables` though.
  - `void __do_page_fault(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned long error_code, unsigned long address)`
      - `int vmalloc_fault(unsigned long address)`
      - `void bad_area(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned long error_code, unsigned long address)`
      - `int expand_stack(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address)`
      - `int handle_mm_fault(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address, unsigned int flags)`
  - COW thing
      - share page tables and set write protection:`unsigned long copy_one_pte(struct mm_struct *dst_mm, struct mm_struct *src_mm, pte_t *dst_pte, pte_t *src_pte, struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long addr, int *rss)`
      - copy on write `int do_wp_page(struct fault_env *fe, pte_t orig_pte)'

- C standard
  - The sizeof and _Alignof operators (ISO/IEC 9899:201x 6.5.3.4)

        > The value of the result of both operators is implementation-defined, ...

- Kernel process management
  - ? how stack is controlled (it's always in kernel virtual memory space right?)
      - ? should read Documentation/x86/kernel-stacks
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK` is unset on my machine
      - user mode stack and kernel mode stack ??
  - how "shutdown", "reboot" is defined?
      - read systemd-halt.service(8) and systemd/src/core/shutdown.c
      - but, there's a systemcall for reboot(2)

      > If  the  executable is a dynamically linked ELF executable, the interpreter named in the PT_INTERP segment is used to load  the needed  shared objects.  This interpreter is typically /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for binaries linked with glibc.

  - getauxval(3)

       > ... the auxiliary vector, a mechanism that the kernel's ELF binary loader uses to pass certain information to user space when a program is executed.
       > ... The primary consumer of the information in the auxiliary vector is the dynamic linker ld-linux.so(8).
